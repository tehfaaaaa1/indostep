                <p>Indo Step was founded on the same belief in the importance of exploration that distinguishes the
                    National Geographic Society's 130-year history. Launched in 1999, Indo Step now operates hundreds of
                    trips each year, spanning all seven continents and more than 80 destinations.

                    Since its founding in 1888, the Society has developed incredible resources—from its network of
                    experts, contacts, and Society-sponsored researchers all over the globe, to the top-tier editorial
                    staff of National Geographic and National Geographic Traveler magazines, and the books, maps, and
                    film and television divisions. Indo Step taps these resources to create unique and authentic
                    expeditions to fascinating parts of the world.

                    Indo Step aims to fulfill the Society's mission to inspire people to care about the planet by
                    providing meaningful opportunities to explore it. Proceeds from all travel programs support the
                    Society’s efforts to increase global understanding through exploration, education and scientific
                    research.</p>
