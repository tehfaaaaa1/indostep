                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Our Philosophy</h2>
                <p>At INEco, ecotourism is more than just a buzzword; it's the core of our operations. We are committed
                    to ensuring that every journey we facilitate respects the delicate balance of ecosystems and
                    cultural heritage. This means working closely with local guides and communities, supporting small
                    businesses, minimizing waste, promoting conservation awareness among travelers, and contributing a
                    portion of our proceeds to environmental protection and community development projects in the areas
                    we visit. Our goal is to create authentic, enriching experiences that leave a positive footprint.
